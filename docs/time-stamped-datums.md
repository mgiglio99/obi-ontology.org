OBI's preferred datum, quality, and value specification approach can be enhanced with time data points in a few ways.   

- Assays and other processes can be marked with start and/or stop times, and therefore any specified output would have those time points to mark its relevance [**using which relations????**]. 
- Any datum's existing value specification(s) can be accompanied by a time value specification, effectively making it a 2-dimensional or n-dimensional observation.

Currently a `time stamped measurement datum` exists to associate time directly with a datum rather than the process that led to it; however this older term is under discussion as it needs clarification.
