Process models and data items can be enhanced with time information in a few ways.   

- Assays and other processes can be marked with start and/or stop times, and therefore any specified output would have those time points to mark its relevance [**using which relations????**]. 

- Any datum's existing value specification(s) can be accompanied by a time value specification, effectively making it a 2-dimensional or n-dimensional observation. In other words, value specifications, as long as they are unambiguously about (`specifies value of`) different things, are additive. 

Here is a diagram showing a generic "time stamped measurement datum" that is about some time and quality.

More specifically, here's a `time stamped geolocation datum` about a latitude and longitude. It references two seperate value specifications which have degree units but are distinguishable by what they are about. Each of these value specifications could detail (i.e. be the metadata for) a column in a spreadsheet. The instance tripple below would be the conversion into owl/rdf of the row fields.

In summary, n-dimensional datums are achieved by the additive or conjunctive nature of value specifications:

In OBI a [`time stamped measurement datum`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000582) exists to associate time directly with a datum; however this older term is complex (it offers a datum within a datum) and may be retired.
