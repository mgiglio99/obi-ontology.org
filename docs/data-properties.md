### Questions: Allow "has specified value" to have domain of any ICE?  Or introduce "has value" implementation?

This brings us to the collection of data - where specific protocols or instruments are used, generating data on particular scales and scientific units.

An ontology data property is a relation from an entity instance straight to some literal datatype (xsd:decimal, xsd:string, xsd:anyURI, etc.) that is a measure/estimate of what that data property is about. In an ontology one might find a `has age` data property used to express that Lee's age is 12, as shown to the right. OBI doesn't promote this approach, as explained below.

The label of the data property tells humans in hopefully plain language what the value is about, but a computer will have a bad time guessing what the relation is equivalent to in other graphs that have differently named or identified relations, which spells trouble for data sharing unless the roster of data properties is a common standard.  As shown, the problem is magnified if other age quantities are involved.

In fact there are many kinds of [`ages`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0001167) in the biomedical realm; a number from OBI are listed here. We're either faced with creating a litany of data properties, or of trying another approach to supply measurements and their semantics. OBI has chosen a data modelling vocabulary that focuses on describing a core entity's role, quality, information content and other descriptive components rather than directly connecting semantically opaque data properties. Below is an example focusing on providing values for information content entities (typical personal information like email address, street address, and social security number) connected to a person instance.

OBI uses data properties in a very limited way, via `has measurement value`,  `has specified value`, and `has specified numeric value`, and relying on the subject of the relation to provide the `aboutness` semantics.  This approach reduces the amount of language needed to describe entities, at the cost of a bit more structure. *Most importantly it enables entities to be the focus of semantic elaboration (axioms) rather than being surrounded by opaque relations.* The `aboutness` details have the extra benefit of facilitating appropriate data exchange between ontology-driven systems.  By specifying that a string field is about a first name or a last name, maiden name, full name, SIN number, postal code, etc. this then provides the core 'aboutness' information that guides the merging and federated querying of triple store graphs.

Suitable object properties:

- `inheres in` or `bearer of` object property if ...???
- `denotes` if the ICE is a type of **identifier**, such as a [`centrally registered identifier symbol`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000577) like a [`specimen identifier`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0001616) or a NCIT [`identifier`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C25364) for example.
- 'location of' if the literal value X is locating the given entity by a geospatial reference. ????

Now, back to the age example, it looks like we could supply various age measurements like this:

Rather than establish a `has age` data property, OBI expresses that [`age`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PATO_0000011) is a quality of our entity, and then focus on defining the semantics of it and its subclasses.  However, there are some limitations of the `has ... value` data property that this diagram and the one below expose.

<img align="right" src="/assets/images/docs/data_lee_data_properties.png">

- Data properties can't support units directly, so a second data property is required to eliminate ambiguity.  Is Lee a 12 year old youth, or a 12 month old toddler?  We need the **unit of measure**, in minutes, days, months, or years.   In the example diagram of Lee's data properties to right, is the `has weight` decimal value given in kilos or grams? Is height in meters or centimetres? Without an explicit unit, assumptions are made about units associated with a data property.

- A data property doesn't support a relevant time of measurement value.  For example, when was Lee's `has height` observed, and was it the same time as `has weight`, such that an accurate BMI can be calculated?  Admittedly, time differentiated data is rather complex to model in OWL. A pragmatic approach, if workable, is to only expose to an OWL reasoner data that doesn't need to be differentiated by time. In the BMI example, we could assume height and weight data properties are adequately close in time that derivative calculations are ok. OBI does offer annother approach detailed in the `Time-stamped data` section to describe n-dimensional points that include time.

- A data property cannot directly specify the range of ontology term choices (which are classes or individuals) for a categorical value since data property ranges can only be drawn from xml/rdf data types. "anon:Lee `has handedness` "http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PATO_0002201^^xsd:anyURI"" but the URI could point to anything on the internet. We can't express in OWL that the 'has handedness' data property URI range must fall within the class of PATO `handedness`.

To answer the above needs, OBI introduced an additional `value specification` entity, as detailed in the next section.
