Here we describe 'standard' OBI elements that are well-defined within the BFO upper ontology and have robust definitions. Early users and developers should refer to this documentation to understand core aspects of the OBI formulation. 

* [Core Classes](/docs/core-classes) - describes the basic class hierarchy of OBI with a walkthrough of how we describe scientific methodology.
