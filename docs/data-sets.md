A collection of datums of a given data type is called a [`data set`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000100){:target="_blank"}. A numeric data set (like a numeric spreadsheet column) can have statistical calculations performed on it by using an RDF query language like [SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL).  The [`member of`](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002350){:target="_blank"} relation can connect datum or value specification instances to such a data set.
