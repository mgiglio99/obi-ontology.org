## Genomic Epidemiology Ontology (GenEpiO), The FoodOn food ontology, and the Genomic Epidemiology Entity Mart (GEEM)

The Genomic Epidemiology Ontology (GenEpiO) project aims to develop a more comprehensive controlled vocabulary for infectious disease surveillance and outbreak investigations. To support foodborn disease informatics, FoodOn, an offshoot of GenEpiO and ENVO, describes food samples by organism, ingredient, packaging, food processing history etc.. GEEM is a software tool to take standards composed within ontologies according to OBI value specifications, and turn them into JSON, HTML form, and other formats for use in software to support data validation and exchange.
