This user manual is designed to explain the core functionality of OBI for newcomers, and to serve as a canonical reference for OBI developers. This is a work in progress, but here we detail and provide a roadmap for OBI building blocks. 

# Basic Documentation

* **[Core Class Definitions](/docs/core-classes/)** (basic formulation of the types found in the ontology - start here to learn components of a biomedical investigation)
* **[Data Modelling](/docs/data-intro/)** (explains how material entity qualities are modeled as process inputs and outputs, and how to define value specifications associated with them for data collection and analysis.)
* **[Process Modelling](/docs/process-intro/)** (explains how to carry out a strategy of top-down modelling)

<!-- 
* **Extended Class Definitions** (working models for specific subdomains and specializations of OBI beyond the core classes) 
* **Example Use Cases** (how we describe specific use cases with OBI) 
* **Implementation and Development Notes** (how we develop, extend and implement the ontology)
* **Community** (Description of the OBI development community. Who were are and what our goals are for this work)
-->

More background and detail on OBI vocabulary and functionality is available in papers listed on the [Media](/media/) page.
